# Redevelopment of https://www.dta.gov.au

## About

The Digital Transformation Agency is redeveloping its website, [https://www.dta.gov.au](https://www.dta.gov.au).

The DTA has chosen to use the GovCMS Drupal 8 distribution as the basis for the site. We are dedicated to building a viable GovCMS distribution for Drupal 8 and will contribute back to the GovCMS project as much as we can.

Please note this repository is designed to integrate with the DTA's environment and may not be suitable for your needs. Please leave an issue if you have any questions around deployment.

## Installation

Information on installing GovCMS 8 is available from [https://github.com/govCMS/govCMS8](https://github.com/govCMS/govCMS8).

## Dependencies

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

Run `composer install` to initialise the site. You will need to update your specific database connection settings and local development environment.
